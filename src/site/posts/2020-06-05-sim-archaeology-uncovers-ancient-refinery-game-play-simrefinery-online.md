Two weeks ago Phil Salvador published a long [essay on the history of the Maxis business division](https://obscuritory.com/sim/when-simcity-got-serious/), a spin-off from the creator of Simcity.

It's a tale of a struggling business unit trying to satisfy the whimsical market for corporate "sim"-type games in the mid-90s. 

The unit famously produced a title called SimRefinery for Chevron, which disappeared a quarter of a century ago and only remained as a memory.

That was until Salvador's article got mainstream attention. The story reached a retired Chevron chemical engineer who still had a working copy of the game on floppy disk and was able to get it running again.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">After 28 years, a copy of SimRefinery has been successfully recovered.<br><br>More information here: <a href="https://t.co/gMInXXYucp">https://t.co/gMInXXYucp</a> <a href="https://t.co/BMZxeSqJhl">pic.twitter.com/BMZxeSqJhl</a></p>&mdash; Phil Salvador (@itstheshadsy) <a href="https://twitter.com/itstheshadsy/status/1268755952838348800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2020</a></blockquote>

The game is now safely preserved at [the Internet Archive where you can play it online](https://archive.org/details/simrefinery) in your browser. Keep in mind it's a business tool rather than a game, so while it was built on the same game engine it's definitely not as accessible as the original SimCity.

So why not give it a play this weekend, or at least read the [original essay that uncovered this archaeological treasure](https://obscuritory.com/sim/when-simcity-got-serious/). Let us know if you manage to blow up your refinery.
