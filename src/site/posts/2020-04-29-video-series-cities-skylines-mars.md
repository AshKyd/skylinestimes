Mars and Earth have approximately the same landmass even though Mars has only 15% of the Earth’s volume, because around two thirds of the Earth’s surface is covered in water. That leaves a lot of terrain for development which is exactly what mayor Citywokcitywall has done in their new Youtube series: City Skylines Mars.

Set in a grim future where Mars has been colonised by a hyper-divided society of the idle rich & exploited poor, the series shows the progress of a detailed multi-level Cities Skylines build.

> Everyday... wars, disease, famine, pollution. You see an ad on the subway, "MOVE TO MARS". The commercials tell you a better life awaits, leave your worries behind! 
>
> You're on a spaceship, waking up from cryosleep. As you and hundreds of others exit a tunnel into the colony, your heart sinks. Sewage leaks from pipes overhead, trash piles up in corners, thousands cram through dirty open-air markets, others sleep in the streets. 
>
> You look up towards the glass dome ceiling. 200 feet above your head a blooming jacaranda sheds its flowers into a gurgling garden fountain. 
>
> "How do we get up there?" you ask. 
>
> Someone answers, "You can't".

Throughout the series, mayor Citywokcitywall shows the construction of the city and explains their the clever use of assets required to pull it off.
