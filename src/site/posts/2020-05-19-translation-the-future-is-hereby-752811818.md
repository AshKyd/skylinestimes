What could it all mean? This morning the official Cities Skylines Twitter posted a cryptic message to their account:

<figure class="aligncenter"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="und" dir="ltr">01110100 01101000 01100101 00100000 01100110 01110101 01110100 01110101 01110010 01100101 00100000 01101001 01110011 00100000 01101000 01100101 01110010 01100101 <br><br>01100010 01111001 00100000 00110111 00110101 00110010 00111000 00110001 00110001 00111000 00110001 00111000 <a href="https://t.co/E1Bt7fXFtp">pic.twitter.com/E1Bt7fXFtp</a></p>&mdash; Cities: Skylines Sunset Harbor (@CitiesSkylines) <a href="https://twitter.com/CitiesSkylines/status/1262715912672731143?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 19, 2020</a></blockquote></figure>

After some confusion, tech savy mayors realised this [binary message could be decoded](https://cryptii.com/pipes/binary-to-text) to read: 

>the future is hereby 752811818

But what could it mean? A [follow-up tweet from Paradox Interactive](https://twitter.com/PdxInteractive/status/1262728449258598401) only added to the mystery: “Ok @StellarisGame. You had your fun. Get off this channel. Back to your room!”

## What is the future?

Could this mysterious message from the future be referring to [Cities Skylines asset architect 752811818](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198278524798/myworkshopfiles/?appid=255710)? And if so, why?

[Mayor Cazgem](https://twitch.tv/cazgem) posted a video discussing the plausibility of an upcoming <em>futuristic building content pack</em>, which makes a lot of sense.

But right now all we have are rumours, so for more clarification we must wait for the future to come to us.
