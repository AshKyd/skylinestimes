Sony have announced a sim theme for their May batch of free downloads on the European Playstation Plus, with the inclusion of Cities: Skylines and Farming Simulator 19.

Skylines on console is often considered the inferior little brother to the desktop version, because it doesn't have access to the wealth of mods and assets in the Steam workshop. But it still has a bustling community of players and streamers, and is a great base game. 

For Playstation gamers the free month is a great good opportunity to discover a genre they otherwise mightn't. But only the base game is available in this free drop, so if you want to play with any of the extra add-on content you will still need to spend some moolah.

PlayStation Plus is a subscription service that gives you online multiplayer, discounts on games from the PlayStation Store, and two free PS4 games to download and play each month.
