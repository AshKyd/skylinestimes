The Cities Skylines Twitch community is a lovely and welcoming place, but with only a few viewers overall it's difficult for new streamers to build an audience.

That's where Twitch Roulette comes in, a new service which randomly drops you the stream of lesser known streamers.

I gave it a few spins and found some amazing streamers I wouldn't have otherwise.

If you're looking for someone new to hang out with through the day, give it a go by clicking the link, or visiting [TwitchRoulette.net](https://twitchroulette.net/).
